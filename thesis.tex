% TODO list
% + To the Curvilinear chapter lead add
%     In Section 2.1 and 2.2 I go through standard vector calculus material
%     because I want to keep the thesis self-contained
%   or similar
% + Margins, line spacing, etc.
% + Title formatting
% + Coerce figures to be on the same page turn if possible
%   i.e. [even-page | odd-page]
% + Hyperlinking
% + PDF bookmarks pane
% + Title page
% + Bureaucratic stuff (declarations etc.)
% + Acknowledgements
% + Remove line numbers
% + Make the PDF file size as small as possible
% + Remove this TODO section

\chapter{Polar coordinates}
\label{ch:polar}

In this chapter, I apply boundary tracing to the thermal radiation problem,
using the fundamental line-source solution
as the known solution to
Laplace's equation~(\ref{eq:laplace-steady-conduction}).

\section{Line-source solution}
\label{sec:polar.line}

First I establish the known solution, the polar coordinate system
and the appropriate scaling.

The line-source solution
to Laplace's equation~(\ref{eq:laplace-steady-conduction})
is usually encountered in electrostatics,
where it represents the potential of a line charge,
logarithmic in the cylindrical radius~$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
In the context of steady conduction,
the only dimensionally consistent form for this is
\begin{important}{equation}
  T = T_0 \log \roundbr*{\frac{r_0}{r}}
  \label{eq:line-laplace-solution}
\end{important}
for some temperature~$T_0$ and radius~$r_0$.%
\footnote{
  Whereas the power law~$T = C r^n$ is scale-invariant,
  requiring only \emph{one} constant~$C$,
  the logarithm does not possess this property;
  separate constants are required for~$T$ and~$r$.
}
Note that the region~$r > r_0$ is unphysical,
since~$T < 0$ therein.

\subsection{Coordinate system}
\label{sec:polar.line.coordinate}

The analysis to follow shall be performed
in the usual polar coordinates~$(r, \phi)$
(see Figure~\tbd),
given by the transformation
\begin{align}
  x &= r \cos\phi, \label{eq:polar-x-transformation} \\
  y &= r \sin\phi. \label{eq:polar-y-transformation}
\end{align}
The local basis vectors are
\begin{align}
  \localvec{r} &=
    \cos\phi \basisvec{x} + \sin\phi \basisvec{y},
    \label{eq:r-local-basis-vector} \\
  \localvec{\phi} &=
    r \roundbr[\big]{-\sin\phi \basisvec{x} + \cos\phi \basisvec{y}},
    \label{eq:phi-local-basis-vector}
\end{align}
the scale factors,
\begin{align}
  \scalefac[r] &= 1, \label{eq:r-scale-factor} \\
  \scalefac[\phi] &= r, \label{eq:phi-scale-factor}
\end{align}
and the local orthonormal basis vectors,
\begin{align}
  \basisvec{r} &= \cos\phi \basisvec{x} + \sin\phi \basisvec{y},
    \label{eq:r-basis-vector} \\
  \basisvec{\phi} &= -\sin\phi \basisvec{x} + \cos\phi \basisvec{y}.
    \label{eq:phi-basis-vector}
\end{align}

\subsection{Scaling}
\label{sec:polar.line.scaling}

While the known solution~(\ref{eq:line-laplace-solution})
already has intrinsic temperature and length scales $T_0$ and~$r_0$,
the final scaling should also account for
the radiation boundary condition~(\ref{eq:radiation-boundary-condition}).

Let
\begin{align}
  \scaled{T} &= T / \tau, \label{eq:line-scaled-temperature} \\
  \scaled{r} &= r / \varrho, \label{eq:line-scaled-r}
\end{align}
with~$\tau$ and~$\varrho$ to be chosen later.
Noting that
\begin{equation}
  \scaleddel = \varrho \del,
  \label{eq:line-scaled-del}
\end{equation}
the radiation boundary condition~(\ref{eq:radiation-boundary-condition})
and the known solution~(\ref{eq:line-laplace-solution})
become
\begin{align}
  \normalvec \dotp \scaleddel \scaled{T}
    &= -\squarebr*{c \varrho \tau^3} \scaled{T}^4,
    \label{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition-with-groups}
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  \scaled{T}
    &=
      \squarebr*{\frac{T_0}{\tau}}
      \log \roundbr*{\frac{\squarebr{r_0 / \varrho}}{\scaled{r}}}.
    \label{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution-with-groups}
\end{align}
There are three dimensionless groups
but only two free scales~$\tau$ and~$\varrho$,
so one of the groups cannot be eliminated.
To keep the logarithmic as simple as possible,
put
\begin{align}
  \tau &= T_0,
    \label{eq:line-temperature-scale} \\
  \varrho &= r_0,
    \label{eq:line-length-scale}
\end{align}
and define the dimensionless group
\begin{equation}
  A = \frac{1}{c r_0 {T_0}^3}.
  \label{eq:line-dimensionless-group}
\end{equation}
Dropping \scalingaccents, the scaled boundary condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition-with-groups})
and known solution~(\ref{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution-with-groups})
become
\begin{important}{align}
  \normalvec \dotp \del T &= -\frac{T^4}{A},
    \label{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition} \\[\fraclinespace]
  T &= -\log r.
    \label{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution}
\end{important}

\section{Viable domain}
\label{sec:polar.viable}

Next, I determine the geometry of the viable domain,
the region where traced boundaries exist.

Comparing the radiation condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition})
to the generic flux condition~(\ref{eq:flux-boundary-condition}),
it follows that the flux function is
\begin{align*}
  F
  &= -\frac{T^4}{A} \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= -\frac{\log^4 r}{A}.
    \yesnumber
    \label{eq:line-flux-function}
\end{align*}
The radial and azimuthal components of the gradient~$\del T$ are
\begin{align}
  P &= \pder{T}{r} = -\frac{1}{r},
    \label{eq:line-gradient-u-component} \\[\fraclinespace]
  Q &= \frac{\pd T}{r \pd\phi} = 0,
    \label{eq:line-gradient-v-component}
\end{align}
and so the viability function is given by
\begin{align*}
  \Phi
  &= (\del T)^2 - F^2 \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= \frac{1}{r^2} - \frac{\log^8 r}{A^2} \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= \frac{A^2 - r^2 \log^8 r}{A^2 r^2} \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= \frac{A^2 - \psi^2}{A^2 r^2},
    \yesnumber
    \label{eq:line-viability-function}
\end{align*}
where $\psi$~is the auxiliary function
\begin{equation}
  \psi (r) \defeq r \log^4 r.
  \label{eq:line-auxiliary-function}
\end{equation}
The viable domain is therefore the region~$\psi (r) \le A$.

\subsection{Auxiliary function properties}
\label{sec:polar.viable.psi}

Since the region~$r > 1$ is unphysical
(corresponding to negative temperature),
it is only necessary to consider~$0 \le r \le 1$.
On this interval, $\psi$~is positive
except at the endpoints~$r = 0$ and~$r = 1$, where it vanishes.
Observing that the slope
\begin{equation}
  \tder{\psi}{r} = (4 + \log r) \log^3 r
  \label{eq:line-psi-derivative}
\end{equation}
changes sign from positive to negative
as $r$~increases through~$\ee^{-4}$,
it follows that $\psi$~has a single maximum on~$0 \le r \le 1$ at
\begin{equation}
  r = r_\nat \defeq \ee^{-4} = 0.01832,
  \label{eq:line-r-natural}
\end{equation}
where it takes the maximal value
\begin{equation}
  \psi
  = A_\nat
  \defeq \psi (r_\nat)
  = (4 / \ee)^4
  = 4.6888.
  \label{eq:line-a-natural}
\end{equation}
This is shown in Figure~\tbd.

\subsection{Three regimes}
\label{sec:polar.viable.regimes}

The topology of the viable domain~$\psi (r) \le A$ will depend
on whether the dimensionless group~$A$ is
greater than, equal to or less than
the critical value~(\ref{eq:line-a-natural}),
as this decides the number of roots of the equation~$\psi (r) = A$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{Cold regime}, $A > A_\nat$ (Figure~\tbd):
    $\psi (r)$~is never equal to~$A$.
    The entire space~$0 \le r \le 1$ is viable,
    and there is no terminal curve.
  \item
    \emph{Transition}, $A = A_\nat$ (Figure~\tbd):
    $\psi (r)$~is equal to~$A$ at~$r = r_\nat$ only.
    The entire space is still viable,
    but now the terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$ has appeared.
    The terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$ is in fact a critical terminal curve,
    since it is a contour of the known solution~%
      (\ref{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution}).
  \item
    \emph{Hot regime}, $A < A_\nat$ (Figure~\tbd):
    $\psi (r)$~is equal to~$A$ at~$r = r_\flat$
    and at~$r = r_\sharp$,
    both dependent on~$A$,
    with~$0 <  r_\flat < r_\nat < r_\sharp < 1$.
    The critical terminal curve now consists of two circles:
    inner, $r = r_\flat$, and outer, $r = r_\sharp$.
    A non-viable moat~$r_\flat < r < r_\sharp$,
    devoid of traced boundaries,
    separates an inner viable island~$0 \le r \le r_\flat$
    from an outer viable mainland~$r \ge r_\sharp$.
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\tbd{}
shows the regimes displayed in the style of a bifurcation diagram,
with state space on the vertical axis
and the parameter~$A$ on the horizontal axis.

\section{Boundary tracing}
\label{sec:polar.tracing}

In this section, I write down the boundary tracing ODE
and show that the construction of convex domains
is only possible in the hot regime~$A < A_\nat$,
on the outer viable mainland~$r \ge r_\nat$.

Using~(\ref{eq:r-scale-factor}) and~(\ref{eq:phi-scale-factor})
(which are unchanged by the scaling)
along with~(\ref{eq:line-flux-function})
through~(\ref{eq:line-viability-function}),
the boundary tracing ODE~(\ref{eq:tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-u})
becomes
\begin{important}{equation}
  \tder{r}{\phi} = \mp \frac{\sqrt{A^2 - \psi^2}}{\log^4 r},
  \label{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r}
\end{important}
so that the traced boundaries are given by
\begin{important}{equation}
  \phi = \mp \int \frac{\log^4 r \td r}{\sqrt{A^2 - \psi^2}}.
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-integral}
\end{important}
This integral is not elementary,
and the traced boundaries must be determined numerically.

At this point it is important to keep in mind the end goal,
which is to construct interesting domains
for which the radiation condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition})
is satisfied along the boundary,
given steady conduction of the form~(\ref{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution}).
Since the nature of the line-source singularity at~$r = 0$
is to supply heat radially at a constant power per length,
the only sensible configuration is for the domain to
completely surround the singularity~$r = 0$ without touching it,
with the power supplied by the singularity balanced
by that lost along the outer boundary by radiation.
Therefore one seeks closed curves,
which surround the origin,
and which, are made by patching together the traced boundaries~%
  (\ref{eq:line-traced-boundary-integral}).

Moreover, it was already seen in Section~\ref{sec:cartesian.slab.tracing}
that only convex domains are acceptable,
lest there be self-incident radiation which is not accounted for
by the simple radiation condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition}).
The patching together of traced boundaries to form closed curves
must therefore be done diligently.

\subsection{Cold regime}
\label{sec:polar.tracing.cold}

Since the sought-after closed curve must surround the origin
and mark out a convex domain,
it may be parametrised in the form~$r = r (\phi)$,
a single-valued function.
Travelling once around the closed curve,
the azimuthal angle~$\phi$ will run through a full turn,
so $r (\phi)$~must also be $2 \pi$-periodic.

Now in the cold regime~$A > A_\nat$,
recall that $\psi (r)$~is always strictly less than~$A$.
It follows that for the two branches of traced boundaries,
corresponding to the two choices of sign in the boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r}),
the upper branch always has $\td r / \td\phi$~negative,
and the lower branch always has $\td r / \td\phi$~positive.%
\footnote{
  For both of the symbols~$\pm$ and~$\mp$,
  the terms \emph{upper} and \emph{lower}
  shall always refer to the choice of sign with that corresponding position.
}
For the sought-after closed curve,
this means that $r (\phi)$~will be strictly decreasing
along the portions which originate from the upper branch,
and strictly increasing along the portions from the lower branch.

Since $r (\phi)$~must be periodic,
the closed curve must therefore consist of both
upper-branch and lower-branch portions.
Travelling in the direction of increasing~$\phi$,
there must eventually be a switching
from the upper branch to the lower branch,
and hence a jump discontinuity in~$\td r / \td\phi$
from negative to positive.
But this corresponds to a non-convex corner
(Figure~\tbd),
so no convex domains can be constructed from traced boundaries
in the cold regime.

\subsection{Transition}
\label{sec:polar.tracing.transition}

For the transition case~$A = A_\nat$,
the two branches of the boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r})
are again segregated by the sign of~$\td r / \td\phi$,
with the exception of the critical terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$,
itself a traced boundary belonging to both branches,
along which~$\psi (r) = A$ and~$\td r / \td\phi = 0$.

Any other closed curve made from traced boundaries
will again consist of portions where $r (\phi)$~is strictly increasing
and other portions where it is strictly decreasing.
To avoid the non-convex corner of Section~\ref{sec:polar.tracing.cold},
any switching from the upper branch to the lower
must occur along~$r = r_\nat$,
so that $\td r / \td\phi$~remains zero across the switch
(thus avoiding the jump from negative to positive).
However, this turns out to be impossible;
$r = r_\nat$~is in fact a limit cycle,
so that no other traced boundary is able to join onto it
within finite time.%
\footnote{
  Time meaning~$\phi$,
  the independent variable of the ODE~%
    (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r})
  viewed as a dynamical system in~$r$-space.
}
To see this,
consider the small perturbation~$r \defeq r_\nat + \xi$,
and let primes denote $r$-differentiation.
Since $\psi (r)$~is maximised at~$r = r_\nat$,
there holds~$\psi' (r_\nat) = 0$, whence
\begin{align*}
  \psi (r_\nat + \xi)
  &=
    \psi (r_\nat) + \frac{1}{2!} \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}
      \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    A_\nat + \frac{1}{2} \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}
\end{align*}
and
\[
  \psi^2 (r_\nat + \xi) =
  {A_\nat}^2 + A_\nat \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2 + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}.
\]
The boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r}),
inverted,
becomes
\begin{align*}
  \mp \tder{\phi}{\xi} = \mp \tder{\phi}{r}
  &=
    \frac{
      \psi (r_\nat + \xi)
    }{
      (r_\nat + \xi) \sqrt{{A_\nat}^2 - \psi^2 (r_\nat + \xi)}
    }
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{
      A_\nat + \order \roundbr*{\xi^2}
    }{
      (r_\nat + \xi)
      \sqrt{
        -A_\nat \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2 + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}
      }
    }
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{\sqrt{A_\nat}}{r_\nat \sqrt{-\psi'' (r_\nat)}}
      \cdot
    \frac{1}{\xi}
    + \order (1)
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{2}{\xi} + \order (1).
\end{align*}
Integrating gives
\[
  \log \xi \asy \const \mp \frac{\phi}{2},
\]
or
\begin{equation}
  r \asy r_\nat + \const \cdot \ee^{\mp \phi / 2}.
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-transition-r-near-r-natural}
\end{equation}
Thus~$r = r_\nat$ is a limit cycle as claimed,
and the only possible closed curve corresponding to a convex domain
in the transition case
is the (boring) critical terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$.

\subsection{Hot regime}
\label{sec:polar.tracing.hot}

In the hot regime~$A < A_\nat$
the critical terminal curve now consists of two circles,
$r = r_\flat$ (inner) and~$r = r_\sharp$ (outer),
both of which are themselves traced boundaries of both branches,
along which~$\psi (r) = A$ and~$\td r / \td\phi = 0$.
Unlike the transition case,
neither of these are limit cycles,
so that other traced boundaries will smoothly attach onto them
within finite time.
Elsewhere the two branches are once again segregated
by the sign of~$\td r / \td\phi$ in the boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r}).
(Note that there are no traced boundaries
in the non-viable annulus~$r_\flat < r < r_\sharp$.)

As before, when travelling in the direction of increasing~$\phi$,
any switching from the upper branch (for which $r (\phi)$~is decreasing)
to the lower branch (for which $r (\phi)$~is increasing)
must take place along either~$r = r_\flat$ or~$r = r_\sharp$,
where $\td r / \td\phi$~vanishes,
otherwise a non-convex corner will be formed
by the jump discontinuity in~$\td r / \td\phi$
from negative to positive.

For traced boundaries in the inner viable island~$0 \le r \le r_\flat$,
this restriction is most severe.
Any closed curve~$r (\phi)$ surrounding the origin~$r = 0$,
which is not simply the inner critical terminal curve~$r = r_\flat$,
must contain a portion taken from the upper branch
in the region~$r < r_\flat$.
This portion will have $r (\phi)$~strictly decreasing,
and to prevent a spiralling in forever
towards the singularity~$r = 0$,
one must eventually switch back to the lower branch.
Since this upper-to-lower switching will take place at some~$r < r_\flat$,
a non-convex corner will be formed
(Figure~\tbd).
Thus, on the inner viable island~$0 \le r \le r_\flat$,
the only convex domain is the trivial disk
whose boundary is the circle~$r = r_\flat$.

Only on the outer viable mainland~$r \ge r_\sharp$
can one construct non-trivial closed curves
which correspond to convex domains,
an analysis which I have deemed worthy of its own section.

\section{Convex domains in the hot regime}
\label{sec:line.convex}

In this section,
I determine the class of possible convex domains
which can only be constructed
on the outer viable mainland~$r \ge r_\sharp$
of the hot regime.

\subsection{Convexity along the outer terminal curve}
\label{sec:line.convex.terminal}

In the cold regime~$A > A_\nat$, the transition case~$A = A_\nat$
and in the inner viable island~$r \le r_\flat$
of the hot regime~$A < A_\nat$,
there was the inevitable appearance of non-convex corners,
caused by a negative-to-positive jump discontinuity in~$\td r / \td\phi$.

On the outer viable mainland~$r \ge r_\sharp$
of the hot regime~$A < A_\nat$,
such non-convex corners can be avoided
by performing all upper-to-lower switching
along the outer critical terminal curve~$r = r_\sharp$,
itself a traced boundary of both branches,
along which~$\td r / \td\phi = 0$.
However, this is not sufficient to rule out
\emph{smooth} non-convexity at the switch,
caused instead by $\td^2 r / {\td\phi}^2$~being finite but too large.
Consider a small perturbation~$r = r_\sharp + \xi$,
with $\xi$~positive.
Observing that
\begin{align*}
  \psi (r_\sharp + \xi)
  &=
    \psi (r_\sharp) + \psi' (r_\sharp) \cdot \xi
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^2}
      \\
  &=
    A + \psi' (r_\sharp) \cdot \xi
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^2}
\end{align*}
and
\[
  \psi^2 (r_\sharp + \xi) =
  A^2 + 2 A \psi' (r_\sharp) \cdot \xi + \order \roundbr*{\xi^2},
\]
the inverted version of the boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r})
becomes
\begin{align*}
  \mp \tder{\phi}{\xi} = \mp \tder{\phi}{r}
  &=
    \frac{
      \psi (r_\sharp + \xi)
    }{
      (r_\sharp + \xi) \sqrt{A^2 - \psi^2 (r_\sharp + \xi)}
    }
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{
      A + \order (\xi)
    }{
      (r_\sharp + \xi)
      \sqrt{-2 A \psi' (r_\sharp) \cdot \xi + \order \roundbr*{\xi^2}}
    }
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{1}{r_\sharp}
    \sqrt{\frac{2 A}{-\psi' (r_\sharp)}}
      \cdot
    \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\xi}}
    + \order \roundbr*{\sqrt{\xi}},
\end{align*}
which integrates to give
\begin{align*}
  \mp \phi
  &=
    \frac{1}{r_\sharp}
    \sqrt{\frac{2 A}{-\psi' (r_\sharp)}}
      \cdot
    \sqrt{\xi}
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^{3/2}} \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \sqrt{\frac{2 (-\log r_\sharp)}{r_\sharp (4 + \log r_\sharp)}}
      \cdot
    \sqrt{\xi}
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^{3/2}}
\end{align*}
up to a constant,
whence to first order, there holds
\begin{equation}
  \xi \asy
  \frac{r_\sharp (4 + \log r_\sharp)}{2 (-\log r_\sharp)} \cdot \phi^2.
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-hot-xi-near-r-sharp}
\end{equation}
Note that both~$(4 + \log r_\sharp)$ and~$(-\log r_\sharp)$ are positive,
since~$1 > r_\sharp > r_\nat \defeq \ee^{-4}$.
While the asymptotic result~(\ref{eq:line-traced-boundary-hot-xi-near-r-sharp})
confirms that the traced boundaries of the outer viable mainland
do indeed attach smoothly
onto the outer critical terminal curve~$r = r_\sharp$
within finite time,
even without forming a non-convex corner,
it is not sufficient to rule out smooth non-convexity.
From Figure~\tbd,
the equation of a tangent line to the circle~$r = r_\sharp$
(up to a constant in~$\phi$)
is
\begin{equation}
  r_\sharp = (r_\sharp + \xi) \cos\phi
  \label{eq:circle-tangent-line}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{align*}
  \xi
  &= r_\sharp (\sec\phi - 1) \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= \frac{r_\sharp}{2} \cdot \phi^2 + \order \roundbr*{\phi^4}.
    \yesnumber
    \label{eq:circle-tangent-line-xi-near-r-sharp}
\end{align*}
Comparing coefficients of~$\phi^2$
in~(\ref{eq:line-traced-boundary-hot-xi-near-r-sharp})
for a traced boundary touching the circle~$r = r_\sharp$
and~(\ref{eq:circle-tangent-line-xi-near-r-sharp}) for a tangent line,
it follows that the traced boundary will only be convex
at the point of tangency
if
\[
  \frac{r_\sharp (4 + \log r_\sharp)}{2 (-\log r_\sharp)}
    \le
  \frac{r_\sharp}{2},
\]
which simplifies to
\begin{equation}
  r_\sharp \le \ee^{-2}.
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-hot-convex-r-sharp-upper-bound}
\end{equation}
Remembering that~$r_\sharp > r_\nat \defeq \ee^{-4}$,
the total range over which convexity is possible
(at least at the point of tangency on~$r = r_\sharp$)
is
\begin{equation}
  \ee^{-4} < r_\sharp \le \ee^{-2},
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-hot-convex-r-sharp-interval}
\end{equation}
and since $A = \psi (r_\sharp)$ is a decreasing function of~$r_\sharp$
over this interval,
the corresponding interval for~$A$ is
\[
  \psi \roundbr*{\ee^{-2}} \le A < \psi \roundbr*{\ee^{-4}},
\]
or
\begin{equation}
  2.1654 = (4 / \ee)^2 \le A < (4 / \ee)^4 = 4.6888.
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-hot-convex-a-interval}
\end{equation}
If the dimensionless group~$A$ lies outside of this interval,
then the traced boundaries on the outer viable mainland
will assuredly correspond to concave domains.
But it is important to realise that
the restriction~(\ref{eq:line-traced-boundary-hot-convex-a-interval})
only guarantees convexity at~$r = r_\sharp$;
the condition is not sufficient to ensure convexity for all~$r \ge r_\sharp$.
In fact eventual concavity is inevitable
as one travels outward along the lower branch towards~$r = 1$,
since the traced boundaries will form thin, concave spikes of the form
\begin{equation}
  \phi \asy \const \mp \frac{(1 - r)^5}{5 A}
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-r-near-1}
\end{equation}
near~$r = 1$,
similar to the thin spikes~(\ref{eq:slab-traced-boundary-x-near-0})
of the slab solution (Section~\ref{sec:cartesian.slab.tracing}).

\chapter{Polar coordinates}
\label{ch:polar}

In this chapter, I apply boundary tracing to the thermal radiation problem,
using the fundamental line-source solution
as the known solution to
Laplace's equation~(\ref{eq:laplace-steady-conduction}).

\section{Line-source solution}
\label{sec:polar.line}

Consider the line-source solution
to Laplace's equation~(\ref{eq:laplace-steady-conduction}),
which is logarithmic in the cylindrical radius~$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
In the context of steady conduction,
the only dimensionally consistent form for this is
\begin{important}{equation}
  T = T_0 \log \roundbr*{\frac{r_0}{r}}
  \label{eq:line-laplace-solution}
\end{important}
for some temperature~$T_0$ and radius~$r_0$.%
\footnote{
  Whereas the power law~$T = C r^n$ is scale-invariant,
  requiring only \emph{one} constant~$C$,
  the logarithm does not possess this property;
  separate constants are required for~$T$ and~$r$.
}
Note that the region~$r > r_0$ is unphysical,
since~$T < 0$ therein.

The analysis to follow shall be performed
in the usual polar coordinates~$(r, \phi)$
(see Figure~\tbd),
given by the transformation
\begin{align}
  x &= r \cos\phi, \label{eq:polar-x-transformation} \\
  y &= r \sin\phi. \label{eq:polar-y-transformation}
\end{align}
The local basis vectors are
\begin{align}
  \localvec{r} &=
    \cos\phi \basisvec{x} + \sin\phi \basisvec{y},
    \label{eq:r-local-basis-vector} \\
  \localvec{\phi} &=
    r \roundbr[\big]{-\sin\phi \basisvec{x} + \cos\phi \basisvec{y}},
    \label{eq:phi-local-basis-vector}
\end{align}
the scale factors,
\begin{align}
  \scalefac[r] &= 1, \label{eq:r-scale-factor} \\
  \scalefac[\phi] &= r, \label{eq:phi-scale-factor}
\end{align}
and the local orthonormal basis vectors,
\begin{align}
  \basisvec{r} &= \cos\phi \basisvec{x} + \sin\phi \basisvec{y},
    \label{eq:r-basis-vector} \\
  \basisvec{\phi} &= -\sin\phi \basisvec{x} + \cos\phi \basisvec{y}.
    \label{eq:phi-basis-vector}
\end{align}

\section{Scaling}
\label{sec:polar.scaling}

While the known solution~(\ref{eq:line-laplace-solution})
already has intrinsic temperature and length scales $T_0$ and~$r_0$,
the final scaling should also account for
the radiation boundary condition~(\ref{eq:radiation-boundary-condition}).

Let
\begin{align}
  \scaled{T} &= T / \tau, \label{eq:line-scaled-temperature} \\
  \scaled{r} &= r / \varrho, \label{eq:line-scaled-r}
\end{align}
with~$\tau$ and~$\varrho$ to be chosen later.
Noting that
\begin{equation}
  \scaleddel = \varrho \del,
  \label{eq:line-scaled-del}
\end{equation}
the radiation boundary condition~(\ref{eq:radiation-boundary-condition})
and the known solution~(\ref{eq:line-laplace-solution})
become
\begin{align}
  \normalvec \dotp \scaleddel \scaled{T}
    &= -\squarebr*{c \varrho \tau^3} \scaled{T}^4,
    \label{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition-with-groups}
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  \scaled{T}
    &=
      \squarebr*{\frac{T_0}{\tau}}
      \log \roundbr*{\frac{\squarebr{r_0 / \varrho}}{\scaled{r}}}.
    \label{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution-with-groups}
\end{align}
There are three dimensionless groups
but only two free scales~$\tau$ and~$\varrho$,
so one of the groups cannot be eliminated.
To keep the logarithmic as simple as possible,
put
\begin{align}
  \tau &= T_0,
    \label{eq:line-temperature-scale} \\
  \varrho &= r_0,
    \label{eq:line-length-scale}
\end{align}
and define the dimensionless group
\begin{equation}
  A = \frac{1}{c r_0 {T_0}^3}.
  \label{eq:line-dimensionless-group}
\end{equation}
Dropping \scalingaccents, the scaled boundary condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition-with-groups})
and known solution~(\ref{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution-with-groups})
become
\begin{important}{align}
  \normalvec \dotp \del T &= -\frac{T^4}{A},
    \label{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition} \\[\fraclinespace]
  T &= -\log r.
    \label{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution}
\end{important}

\section{Viable domain}
\label{sec:polar.viable}

Comparing the radiation condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition})
to the generic flux condition~(\ref{eq:flux-boundary-condition}),
it follows that the flux function is
\begin{align*}
  F
  &= -\frac{T^4}{A} \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= -\frac{\log^4 r}{A}.
    \yesnumber
    \label{eq:line-flux-function}
\end{align*}
The radial and azimuthal components of the gradient~$\del T$ are
\begin{align}
  P &= \pder{T}{r} = -\frac{1}{r},
    \label{eq:line-gradient-u-component} \\[\fraclinespace]
  Q &= \frac{\pd T}{r \pd\phi} = 0,
    \label{eq:line-gradient-v-component}
\end{align}
and so the viability function is given by
\begin{align*}
  \Phi
  &= (\del T)^2 - F^2 \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= \frac{1}{r^2} - \frac{\log^8 r}{A^2} \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= \frac{A^2 - r^2 \log^8 r}{A^2 r^2} \\[\fraclinespace]
  &= \frac{A^2 - \psi^2}{A^2 r^2},
    \yesnumber
    \label{eq:line-viability-function}
\end{align*}
where $\psi$~is the auxiliary function
\begin{equation}
  \psi (r) \defeq r \log^4 r.
  \label{eq:line-auxiliary-function}
\end{equation}
The viable domain is therefore the region~$\psi (r) \le A$.

\subsection{Auxiliary function properties}
\label{sec:polar.viable.psi}

Since the region~$r > 1$ is unphysical
(corresponding to negative temperature),
it is only necessary to consider~$0 \le r \le 1$.
On this interval, $\psi$~is positive
except at the endpoints~$r = 0$ and~$r = 1$, where it vanishes.
Observing that the slope
\begin{equation}
  \tder{\psi}{r} = (4 + \log r) \log^3 r
  \label{eq:line-psi-derivative}
\end{equation}
changes sign from positive to negative
as $r$~increases through~$\ee^{-4}$,
it follows that $\psi$~has a single maximum on~$0 \le r \le 1$ at
\begin{equation}
  r = r_\nat \defeq \ee^{-4} = 0.01832,
  \label{eq:line-r-natural}
\end{equation}
where it takes the maximal value
\begin{equation}
  \psi
  = A_\nat
  \defeq \psi (r_\nat)
  = (4 / \ee)^4
  = 4.6888.
  \label{eq:line-a-natural}
\end{equation}
This is shown in Figure~\tbd.

\subsection{Three regimes}
\label{sec:polar.viable.regimes}

The topology of the viable domain~$\psi (r) \le A$ will depend
on whether the dimensionless group~$A$ is
greater than, equal to or less than
the critical value~(\ref{eq:line-a-natural}),
as this decides the number of roots of the equation~$\psi (r) = A$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{Cold regime}, $A > A_\nat$ (Figure~\tbd):
    $\psi (r)$~is never equal to~$A$.
    The entire space~$0 \le r \le 1$ is viable,
    and there is no terminal curve.
  \item
    \emph{Transition}, $A = A_\nat$ (Figure~\tbd):
    $\psi (r)$~is equal to~$A$ at~$r = r_\nat$ only.
    The entire space is still viable,
    but now the terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$ has appeared.
    The terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$ is in fact a critical terminal curve,
    since it is a contour of the known solution~%
      (\ref{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution}).
  \item
    \emph{Hot regime}, $A < A_\nat$ (Figure~\tbd):
    $\psi (r)$~is equal to~$A$ at~$r = r_\flat$
    and at~$r = r_\sharp$,
    both dependent on~$A$,
    with~$0 <  r_\flat < r_\nat < r_\sharp < 1$.
    The critical terminal curve now consists of
    the two circles~$r = r_\flat$ and~$r = r_\sharp$.
    A non-viable moat~$r_\flat < r < r_\sharp$
    separates an inner viable island~$0 \le r \le r_\flat$
    from an outer viable mainland~$r \ge r_\sharp$.
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\tbd{}
shows the regimes displayed in the style of a bifurcation diagram,
with state space on the vertical axis
and the parameter~$A$ on the horizontal axis.

\section{Boundary tracing}
\label{sec:polar.tracing}

Using~(\ref{eq:r-scale-factor}) and~(\ref{eq:phi-scale-factor})
(which are unchanged by the scaling)
along with~(\ref{eq:line-flux-function})
through~(\ref{eq:line-viability-function}),
the boundary tracing ODE~(\ref{eq:tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-u})
becomes
\begin{important}{equation}
  \tder{r}{\phi} = \mp \frac{\sqrt{A^2 - \psi^2}}{\log^4 r},
  \label{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r}
\end{important}
so that the traced boundaries are given by
\begin{important}{equation}
  \phi = \mp \int \frac{\log^4 r \td r}{\sqrt{A^2 - \psi^2}}.
  \label{eq:line-traced-boundary-integral}
\end{important}
This integral is not elementary,
and the traced boundaries must be determined numerically.

At this point one should keep in mind the end goal,
which is to construct interesting domains
for which the radiation condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition})
is satisfied along the boundary,
given steady conduction of the form~(\ref{eq:line-scaled-laplace-solution}).
Since the nature of the line-source singularity at~$r = 0$
is to supply heat radially at a constant power per length,
the only sensible configuration is for the domain to
completely surround the singularity~$r = 0$ without touching it,
with the power supplied by the singularity balanced
by that lost along the outer boundary by radiation.
Therefore one seeks closed curves,
which surround the origin,
and which, are made by patching together the traced boundaries~%
  (\ref{eq:line-traced-boundary-integral}).

Moreover, it was already seen in Section~\ref{sec:cartesian.slab.tracing}
that only convex domains are acceptable,
lest there be self-incident radiation which is not accounted for
by the simple radiation condition~%
  (\ref{eq:line-scaled-radiation-boundary-condition}).
The patching together of traced boundaries to form closed curves
must therefore be done carefully.

\subsection{Cold regime}
\label{sec:polar.tracing.cold}

Since the sought-after closed curve must surround the origin
and mark out a convex domain,
it may be parametrised in the form~$r = r (\phi)$,
a single-valued function.
Travelling once around the closed curve,
the azimuthal angle~$\phi$ will run through a full turn,
so $r (\phi)$~must also be $2 \pi$-periodic.

Now in the cold regime~$A > A_\nat$,
recall that $\psi (r)$~is always strictly less than~$A$.
It follows that for the two branches of traced boundaries,
corresponding to the two choices of sign in the boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r}),
the upper branch always has $\td r / \td\phi$~negative,
and the lower branch always has $\td r / \td\phi$~positive.%
\footnote{
  For both of the symbols~$\pm$ and~$\mp$,
  the terms \emph{upper} and \emph{lower}
  shall always refer to the choice of sign with that corresponding position.
}
For the sought-after closed curve,
this means that $r (\phi)$~will be strictly decreasing
along the portions which originate from the upper branch,
and strictly increasing along the portions from the lower branch.

Since $r (\phi)$~must be periodic,
the closed curve must therefore consist of both
upper-branch and lower-branch portions.
Travelling in the direction of increasing~$\phi$,
there must eventually be a switching
from the upper branch to the lower branch,
and hence a jump discontinuity in~$\td r / \td\phi$
from negative to positive.
But this corresponds to a non-convex corner
(Figure~\tbd),
so no convex domains can be constructed from traced boundaries
in the cold regime.

\subsection{Transition}
\label{sec:polar.tracing.transition}

For the transition case~$A = A_\nat$,
the two branches of the boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r})
are again segregated by the sign of~$\td r / \td\phi$,
with the exception of the critical terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$,
itself a traced boundary belonging to both branches,
along which~$\psi (r) = A$ and~$\td r / \td\phi = 0$.

Any other closed curve made from traced boundaries
will again consist of portions where $r (\phi)$~is strictly increasing
and other portions where it is strictly decreasing.
To avoid the non-convex corner of Section~\ref{sec:polar.tracing.cold},
any switching from the upper branch to the lower
must occur along~$r = r_\nat$,
so that $\td r / \td\phi$~remains zero across the switch
(thus avoiding the jump from negative to positive).
However, this turns out to be impossible;
$r = r_\nat$~is in fact a limit cycle,
so that no other traced boundary is able to join onto it
within finite time.%
\footnote{
  Time meaning~$\phi$,
  the independent variable of the ODE~%
    (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r})
  viewed as a dynamical system in~$r$-space.
}
To see this,
consider the small perturbation~$r \defeq r_\nat + \xi$,
and let primes denote $r$-differentiation.
Since $\psi (r)$~is maximised at~$r = r_\nat$,
there holds~$\psi' (r_\nat) = 0$, whence
\begin{align*}
  \psi (r_\nat + \xi)
  &=
    \psi (r_\nat) + \frac{1}{2!} \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}
      \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    A_\nat + \frac{1}{2} \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2
    + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}
\end{align*}
and
\[
  \psi^2 (r_\nat + \xi) =
  {A_\nat}^2 + A_\nat \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2 + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}.
\]
The boundary tracing ODE~%
  (\ref{eq:line-tracing-ode-coordinate-parametrisation-r}),
inverted,
becomes
\begin{align*}
  \mp \tder{\phi}{\xi} = \mp \tder{\phi}{r}
  &=
    \frac{
      \psi (r_\nat + \xi)
    }{
      (r_\nat + \xi) \sqrt{{A_\nat}^2 - \psi^2 (r_\nat + \xi)}
    }
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{
      A_\nat + \order \roundbr*{\xi^2}
    }{
      (r_\nat + \xi)
      \sqrt{
        -A_\nat \psi'' (r_\nat) \cdot \xi^2 + \order \roundbr*{\xi^3}
      }
    }
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{\sqrt{A_\nat}}{r_\nat \sqrt{-\psi'' (r_\nat)}}
      \cdot
    \frac{1}{\xi}
    + \order (1)
    \\[\fraclinespace]
  &=
    \frac{2}{\xi} + \order (1).
\end{align*}
Integrating gives
\[
  \log \xi \asy \const \mp \frac{\phi}{2},
\]
or
\begin{equation}
  r \asy r_\nat + \const \cdot \ee^{\mp \phi / 2}.
\end{equation}
Thus~$r = r_\nat$ is a limit cycle as claimed,
and the only possible closed curve corresponding to a convex domain
is the (boring) critical terminal curve~$r = r_\nat$.

\chapter{Polar coordinates}
\label{ch:polar}

In this chapter, I apply boundary tracing to the thermal radiation problem,
using the fundamental line source solution
as the known solution to
Laplace's equation~(\ref{eq:laplace-steady-conduction}).

\section{Line source solution}
\label{sec:polar.line}

Consider the line source solution
to Laplace's equation~(\ref{eq:laplace-steady-conduction}),
which is logarithmic in the cylindrical radius~$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
In the context of steady conduction,
the only dimensionally consistent form for this is
\begin{important}{equation}
  T = T_0 \log \frac{r_0}{r}
  \label{eq:line-laplace-solution}
\end{important}
for some temperature~$T_0$ and radius~$r_0$.
Note that the region~$r > r_0$ is unphysical,
since~$T < 0$ therein.

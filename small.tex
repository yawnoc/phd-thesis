\chapter{Small wedges}
\label{ch:small}

In this chapter
we apply numerical boundary tracing to analyse corner rounding
in small capillary wedges,
for which the wedge half-angle~$\alpha$ and the contact angle~$\gamma$
satisfy the inequality~$\alpha < \pi/2 - \gamma$
and the height rise in the corner is infinite.

The author's Honours thesis~%
  \cite{li-2017-thesis-rounding-capillary-wedge}
considered an asymptotic version of boundary tracing
in which the leading term~(\ref{eq:small-wedge-asymptotic-solution})
was used as the known solution.
Although that analysis was able to produce
a corresponding asymptotic corner rounding,
one could not be certain that the rounding actually lay
within the region of validity
of the asymptotic known solution~(\ref{eq:small-wedge-asymptotic-solution}).
The accuracy of the asymptotic corner rounding
could only be assessed indirectly
by computing a numerical solution in the corresponding rounded-corner domain
(which no longer had a singularity)
and then comparing it
to the asymptotic solution~(\ref{eq:small-wedge-asymptotic-solution}).

It is more preferable to avoid the use of an asymptotic approximation,
so that the results of boundary tracing are applicable throughout the wedge,
rather than only in a near-corner region of unknown size.
Therefore, we determine here a numerical solution
to the scaled capillary BVP~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
and apply boundary tracing to it,
instead of to an asymptotic solution.

\section{Numerical wedge solutions}
\label{sec:small.numerical}

While the numerical solver of Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.numerical}
was able to generate solutions in the small wedge case,
their validity is questionable
given the $1/r$~singularity in the corner.

A better approach involves extracting the singularity
before performing numerical work.
Such an approach has been employed by
Aoki \&~De~Sterck~\cite{aoki-2014-numerical-study-unbounded-capillary}
to determine accurate numerical representations
of unbounded solutions to the capillary problem,
specifically in the case of a general domain with two boundary walls,
$y = f (x)$ and $y = g (x)$,
forming either a small wedge or a cusp at the origin.
In this scenario,
the solution to the capillary problem~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
is unbounded at the origin,
the asymptotic height rise being~$T \asy 1 / (f - g)$.
Their method consists of two parts.
The first is the change of dependent variable
\begin{equation}
  T (x, y) \ideq \frac{H (x, y)}{f (x) - g(x)},
  \label{eq:capillary-unbounded-change-of-variable}
\end{equation}
which ensures that the new dependent variable~$H$ is bounded.
The second is the change of coordinates
\begin{align}
  x &\ideq X, \\
  y &\ideq \frac{1 + Y}{2} f (X) + \frac{1 - Y}{2} g (X),
\end{align}
which maps the original domain $x > 0$, $g (x) < y < f (x)$
to the rectangle $X > 0$, $-1 < Y < 1$.
In particular, this maps the origin~$(x, y) = (0, 0)$
to the line segment $X = 0$, $-1 < Y < 1$,
so that any discontinuity in~$H$ at the origin
(i.e.~a dependence on the direction of approach)
in the original coordinates~$(x, y)$
will not be exhibited in the new coordinates~$(X, Y)$.

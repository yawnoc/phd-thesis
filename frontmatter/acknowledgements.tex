First I express sincere gratitude to my main supervisor,
Dr~Neville Fowkes,
for letting me do whatever I wanted to,
for always being patient,
and for only offering kind words and encouragement,
even during the many weeks wherein I produced nothing.

I thank my co-supervisors
Dr~Brendan Florio and Dr~Miccal Matthews
for their patience also,
and for their invaluable input,
which has greatly improved this thesis.

To Mum \&~Dad:
I am grateful for your eternal support.

To the theoretical physicists,
Benjamin, Daniel, Emmanouil, James, and Michael:
thank you for the many enlightening lunchtime discussions,
mostly comedic, but sometimes intellectual,
during which you did wait patiently for me to finish my food.
Also thank you for your kind gift of a nifty garden hatchet.

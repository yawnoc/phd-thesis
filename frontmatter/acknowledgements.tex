To the theoretical physicists,
Benjamin, Daniel, Emmanouil, James, and Michael:
thank you for the many enlightening lunchtime discussions,
mostly comedic, but sometimes intellectual,
during which you did wait patiently for me to finish my food.
Also thank you for your kind gift of a nifty garden hatchet.

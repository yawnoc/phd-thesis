First I express sincere gratitude to my main supervisor,
Dr~Neville Fowkes,
for letting me do whatever I wanted to,
for always being patient,
and for only offering kind words and encouragement,
even during the many weeks wherein I produced nothing.

To my other supervisors,
Dr~Brendan Florio and Dr~Miccal Matthews:
thank you for your patience also,
and for your invaluable input,
which has greatly improved this thesis.

To Mum \&~Dad:
I am grateful for your eternal support.

To the theoretical physicists,
Benjamin, Daniel, Emmanouil, James, and Michael:
thank you for the many enlightening lunchtime discussions,
mostly comedic, but sometimes intellectual,
during which you did wait patiently for me to finish my food.
Also thank you for your kind gift of a nifty garden hatchet.

Finally, I thank my old friend, even my brother, James Houlahan,
without whose assistance and optimism
I would not have been able to install and run \software{Mathematica}
on my exceedingly cheap \code{aarch64}~laptop,
and, without whose part in a sequence of events in~2019,
I would not have discovered~\software{Git},
without which, I would surely not have completed this doctorate,
neither would the source code for the computations%
  \footnote{\bareurl{https://github.com/yawnoc/phd-code}}
and for this thesis%
  \footnote{\bareurl{https://github.com/yawnoc/phd-thesis}}
be made available online.

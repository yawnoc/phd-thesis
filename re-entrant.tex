\chapter{Re-entrant wedges}
\label{ch:re-entrant}

In this chapter
boundary tracing is applied to re-entrant capillary wedges,
i.e.~wedges with half-angle~$\alpha > \pi/2$.
For simplicity we only consider infinite wedge domains;
this rules out the asymmetric situations observed by
Korevaar~\cite{korevaar-1980-capillary-re-entrant-corner}
and by King~\etal~\cite{king-1999-laplace-young-near-corner}.
We take a numerical solution to
the scaled capillary BVP~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
in a wedge
and seek rounding curves along which
the contact condition~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
remains satisfied.
Finally, practical results are obtained for the dip-coating problem
of Figure~X, % TODO
by embracing the sharp corners
that have heretofore been avoided
for the sake of constructing smooth corner roundings.
% TODO
% Perhaps for the body:
% 'Our avoidance of sharp corners has been most restrictive',
% 'Here we change tack and use them to our advantage', etc.

\section{Numerical wedge solutions}
\label{sec:re-entrant.numerical}

In this section we obtain numerical wedge solutions
to the capillary BVP~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition}).
Finite element meshes are constructed in an identical manner
to Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.numerical.wedge};
the domain is taken to be a sector of radius~$10$,
all mesh elements are required to have no more area
than an equilateral triangle of side length~$0.2$,
and we apply the minimalistic refinement strategy
of Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.numerical.half-plane}
along the two wedge walls,
using a fine length scale of~$0.01$.
Figure~X % TODO
shows the resultant mesh of X~elements
  % TODO (and perhaps a footnote about elements increasing with alpha)
for an $\alpha = \SI{135}{\degree}$~wedge.

As before, we obtain numerical solutions in \software{Mathematica}
by specifying the capillary BVP
as the steady-state diffusion problem~(\ref{eq:laplace-young-diffusion})
\&~(\ref{eq:contact-boundary-condition-diffusion}),
with the non-wetting contact condition~%
  (\ref{eq:natural-boundary-condition-diffusion})
applied on the outer arc~$r = 10$
to approximate a vanishing height rise at infinity.

Having precluded asymmetry,
the solution in the moderate re-entrant case~$\pi/2 < \alpha < \pi/2 + \gamma$
has the locally planar form~%
  (\ref{eq:moderate-wedge-asymptotic-solution}),
and we can compare the theoretical and computed values
for the slope in the corner,
as in Table~X. % TODO
The excellent agreement
and strongly validates our numerical solver.
% TODO
% For \alpha = \pi/2 + \gamma, check against King et al. (46).
% For \alpha > \pi/2 + \gamma, (43) (but note that A is undetermined).

\section{Corner rounding}
\label{sec:re-entrant.rounding}

In this section,
we take the numerical wedge solutions that have just been obtained
and perform boundary tracing
to seek roundings of the wedge corner.

\subsection{Boundary tracing}
\label{sec:re-entrant.rounding.tracing}

First we consider the default case,
where the contact angle for boundary tracing
is the same as the contact angle~$\gamma$
for the known numerical solution~$T$.

Proceeding as in Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.tracing},
the contact condition~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
is rewritten as
\begin{important}{equation}
  \normalvec \dotp \del T = \cos\gamma \sqrt{1 + (\del T)^2},
  \label{eq:scaled-contact-flux-boundary-condition-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{important}
and we again have flux function
\begin{equation}
  F \ideq \cos\gamma \sqrt{1 + (\del T)^2},
  \label{eq:contact-flux-function-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{equation}
viability function
\begin{equation}
  \Phi \ideq \sin^2\gamma \, (\del T)^2 - \cos^2\gamma,
  \label{eq:contact-viability-function-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{equation}
and viable domain
\begin{equation}
  \norm{\del T} \ge \cot\gamma.
  \label{eq:contact-viable-domain-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{equation}
The non-viable domain is shown
in Figure~X. % TODO

\chapter{Re-entrant wedges}
\label{ch:re-entrant}

In this chapter
boundary tracing is applied to re-entrant capillary wedges,
i.e.~wedges with half-angle~$\alpha > \pi/2$.
For simplicity we only consider infinite wedge domains;
this rules out the asymmetric situations observed by
Korevaar~\cite{korevaar-1980-capillary-re-entrant-corner}
and by King~\etal~\cite{king-1999-laplace-young-near-corner}.
We take a numerical solution to
the scaled capillary BVP~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
in a wedge
and seek rounding curves along which
the contact condition~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
remains satisfied.
Finally, practical results are obtained for the dip-coating problem
of Figure~X, % TODO
by embracing the sharp corners
that have heretofore been avoided
for the sake of constructing smooth corner roundings.
% TODO
% Perhaps for the body:
% 'Our avoidance of sharp corners has been most restrictive',
% 'Here we change tack and use them to our advantage', etc.

\section{Numerical wedge solutions}
\label{sec:re-entrant.numerical}

In this section we obtain numerical wedge solutions
to the capillary BVP~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition}).
Finite element meshes are constructed in an identical manner
to Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.numerical.wedge};
we take the domain to be the sector $0 < r < 10$, $-\alpha < \phi < \alpha$,
we require all mesh elements to have no more area
than an equilateral triangle of side length~$0.2$,
and we apply the minimalistic refinement strategy
of Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.numerical.half-plane}
along the two wedge walls,
using a fine length scale of~$0.01$.
Figure~X % TODO
shows the resultant mesh of X~elements
  % TODO (and perhaps a footnote about elements increasing with alpha)
for an $\alpha = \SI{135}{\degree}$~wedge.

As before, we obtain numerical solutions in \software{Mathematica}
by specifying the capillary BVP
as the steady-state diffusion problem~(\ref{eq:laplace-young-diffusion})
\&~(\ref{eq:contact-boundary-condition-diffusion}),
with the non-wetting contact condition~%
  (\ref{eq:natural-boundary-condition-diffusion})
applied on the outer arc~$r = 10$
to approximate a vanishing height rise at infinity.

Having precluded asymmetry,
the solution in the moderate re-entrant case~$\pi/2 < \alpha < \pi/2 + \gamma$
has the locally planar form~%
  (\ref{eq:moderate-wedge-asymptotic-solution}),
and we can compare the theoretical and computed values
for the slope in the corner,
as in Table~X. % TODO
% TODO
% For \alpha = \pi/2 + \gamma, check against King et al. (46).
% For \alpha > \pi/2 + \gamma, (43) (but note that A is undetermined).
% Then a sentence about excellent agreement.

\section{Corner rounding}
\label{sec:re-entrant.rounding}

In this section,
we take the numerical wedge solutions that have just been obtained
and perform boundary tracing
to seek roundings of the wedge corner.

\subsection{Boundary tracing}
\label{sec:re-entrant.rounding.tracing}

First we consider the default case,
where the contact angle for boundary tracing
is the same as the contact angle~$\gamma$
for the known numerical solution~$T$.

Proceeding as in Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.tracing},
the contact condition~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
is rewritten as
\begin{important}{equation}
  \normalvec \dotp \del T = \cos\gamma \sqrt{1 + (\del T)^2},
  \label{eq:scaled-contact-flux-boundary-condition-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{important}
and we again have flux function
\begin{equation}
  F \ideq \cos\gamma \sqrt{1 + (\del T)^2},
  \label{eq:contact-flux-function-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{equation}
viability function
\begin{equation}
  \Phi \ideq \sin^2\gamma \, (\del T)^2 - \cos^2\gamma,
  \label{eq:contact-viability-function-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{equation}
and viable domain
\begin{equation}
  \norm{\del T} \ge \cot\gamma.
  \label{eq:contact-viable-domain-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{equation}
The non-viable domain is shown
in Figure~X. % TODO
Away from the corner but near the walls,
the wedge solution may be approximated by the half-plane solution
with contact angle~$\gamma$
(and hence slope~$\cot\gamma$)
along the wall;
therefore the terminal curve
\begin{equation}
  \norm{\del T} = \cot\gamma
  \label{eq:contact-terminal curve-repeat_re-entrant}
\end{equation}
asymptotes to the wedges walls as one travels away from the wedge corner.
The viable domain lies to the left of the terminal curve
and hugs the wedge walls.

Working in Cartesian coordinates as before,
we have the derivatives
\begin{align}
  P &\ideq \pder{T}{x},
    \label{eq:re-entrant-gradient-x-component} \\[\tallspace]
  Q &\ideq \pder{T}{y}.
    \label{eq:re-entrant-gradient-y-component}
\end{align}
Again the boundary tracing system of ODEs for arc-length parametrisation
reduces to
\begin{important}{align}
  \tder{x}{s} &= \frac{-Q F \pm P \sqrt{\Phi}}{(\del T)^2},
    \label{eq:re-entrant-tracing-ode-arc-length-parametrisation-x}
    \\[\tallspace]
  \tder{y}{s} &= \frac{+P F \pm Q \sqrt{\Phi}}{(\del T)^2},
    \label{eq:re-entrant-tracing-ode-arc-length-parametrisation-y}
\end{important}
and we obtain traced boundaries
as in Figure~X % TODO
by performing numerical integration
from starting points within the viable domain.

\chapter{Re-entrant wedges}
\label{ch:re-entrant}

In this chapter
boundary tracing is applied to re-entrant capillary wedges,
i.e.~wedges with half-angle~$\alpha > \pi/2$.
We take a numerical solution to
the scaled capillary BVP~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
in a wedge
and seek rounding curves along which
the contact condition~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition})
remains satisfied.
Finally, practical results are obtained for the dip-coating problem
of Figure~X, % TODO
by embracing the sharp corners
that have heretofore been avoided
for the sake of constructing smooth corner roundings.
% TODO
% Perhaps for the body:
% 'Our avoidance of sharp corners has been most restrictive',
% 'Here we change tack and use them to our advantage', etc.

\section{Numerical wedge solutions}
\label{sec:re-entrant.numerical}

In this section we obtain numerical wedge solutions
to the capillary BVP~(\ref{eq:scaled-laplace-young})
\&~(\ref{eq:scaled-contact-boundary-condition}).
Finite element meshes are constructed in an identical manner
to Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.numerical.wedge};
the domain is taken to be a sector of radius~$10$,
all mesh elements are required to have no more area
than an equilateral triangle of side length~$0.2$,
and we apply the minimalistic refinement strategy
of Section~\ref{sec:moderate.nonlinear.numerical.half-plane}
along the two wedge walls,
using a fine length scale of~$0.01$.
Figure~X % TODO
shows the resultant mesh of X~elements
  % TODO (and perhaps a footnote about elements increasing with alpha)
for an $\alpha = \SI{135}{\degree}$~wedge.

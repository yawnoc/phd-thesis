\chapter{Concluding remarks}
\label{ch:concluding}

In this thesis,
we have applied the theory of boundary tracing
in the physically significant contexts
of thermal radiation and capillarity.
After deriving general versions of the boundary tracing ODE
(for both coordinate parametrisation
and the numerically robust arc-length parametrisation)
applicable in any orthogonal coordinate system,
we have embarked on a thorough analysis
of the traced boundaries that can be produced in various scenarios:
